# To Do:

## Questions to Answer
- Weekly Grocery list
    - How many groceries should we buy this week based on trends from a range of time?
- Daily Prep list
    - How many items should we be prepared to make given trends from a range of time?
- Time of day trends?
    - Are there times of day that are more popular?
    - Are there categories of items more popular at certain times?

## Visual Stuff
- Item total by day line 
- [x] rolling average line on total sales

## Structural Stuff
- Pull square reports automagically
- If only one date is chosen, line graph should turn into a bar graph
